The "blocate" command can be used like the "locate" command,
except it loops over all [m,p]locate.*.db files you have
in this directory. plocate is the new better format, but there
may be some old mlocate still present.

To make new ones, use something like

  sudo ./do_updatedb u=/media/teuben/raid500_14                           d=raid500_14
  sudo ./do_updatedb u=/media/teuben/21a68621-1ae1-4211-8513-f651e44f7f42 d=1TB-1
  sudo ./do_updatedb u=/media/teuben/Backup                               d=1TB-2
  sudo ./do_updatedb u=/media/teuben/25d99aef-27ad-4747-802d-9ec0832c39bb d=1TB-3

note that depending on the version of locate(1), it may be plocate or mlocate

# [m,p]locate

To convert mlocate into plocate I tried the command

     plocate-build  mlocate.home640.db  plocate.home640.db

but this never worked for me, even when fixing the visibility flag....
In the end, I kept a copy of the (old) mlocate program, so I can read the
old mlocate*db files.

plocate is the way to go, faster and better, so they say.
