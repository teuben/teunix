# teunix

This is my collection of scripts to get my environment set up on a new
unix account. For the shell I keep both -csh an -sh flavors. I cover
both Linux and Darwin flavors of Unix.

I also keep writeups of specifics on a variety of Linux/Darwin
flavors. My linux history goes back to Slackware floppies (1994), then
Redhat and Fedora, but eventually Ubuntu with their Unity window manager.
In 2018 Ubuntu switched to GNOME3, but I decided to switch to KDE,
since I cannot get used to GNOME3.

This repo is purely put together for my own sanity, but you may find
interesting and useful scripts and shell aliases in here.

If you need help with your version of Unix, or with Photography, I could
be persuaded, for a small fee of course.
