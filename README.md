# teunix

My collection of scripts to get my (shell) environment set up on a new
account. Has both -csh an -sh flavors. Now handles both Linux and Darwin.

I also keep writeups of specifics on a variety of Linux (and now Darwin)
flavors. My linux history goes back to Slackware floppies (1994), then
Redhat and Fedora, but eventually Ubuntu with their Unity window manager.
In 2018 Ubuntu is switching to GNOME3, but I may finally try out KDE
in more earnest, as I cannot get used to GNOME3.

This repo is purely put together for my own sanity, but you may find
interesting and useful scripts and shell aliases in here.
