First rule of desktops:
 "don't be fooled how it feels the first few minutes, how does it keep up when
  you are working in multiple desktops and many windows and apps open"


Long history of those once linux came around (lets not talk about SunOS/Solaris anymore)
========================================================================================
- twm
- fvwm
- enlightenment (used that for a while, sad it went, but it's back now)
- xfce4 (wind up never using it, but some of my best friends use it)
- unity (used this until 2017/18?; Ubuntu will kill it off)
- gnome3 (i think it suck, too configurable, too hard to bootstrap, too many things die)
- kde (this might be my next one after all)


My Fav Features
===============
- mouse focus fully configurable, i prefer:
  - focus follows mouse (after something lke 500ms delay)
  - scrolling should be not 'natural' but classic "reverse"
- multiple desktops
- windows need to be able to live always on the desktop (.e.g my emacs)
- a window should be resizeable from all sides and corners
- screenlock should have configurable timeout (I prefer 10-20 mins)
