---+ Sharing Your Computer Screen with a Remote Party
<p dir="ltr">You can share a presentation by sharing your screen or window using Skype, Hangouts or a Webex meeting. If you want to have good audio, it&rsquo;s best to use one of these on the conference room PC, which provides much better microphone and speakers, especially in the big conference room.</p> <p dir="ltr"> *Using Webex to share screen:* </p>

<a target="_blank" href="https://umd.webex.com/mw3000/mywebex/default.do?siteurl=umd">UMD WebEx</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://umd.webex.com/mw3000/mywebex/default.do?siteurl=umd">https://umd.webex.com</a>) is a Web-based meeting and conferencing system, powered by Cisco Systems, Inc., that facilitates collaboration over the Internet using multi-party video conferencing and screen sharing. It is designed to work on PCs, Macs, smartphones, and tablets. If using the room computer, Webex supports video through the room&rsquo;s camera(s), voice and audio through room&rsquo;s microphone(s) and speakers. Webex also supports audio participation through on-campus phone calls to extension x33000, and through phone calls to a global network of dial-in numbers. Please note that toll charges may apply to off-campus dial-in.
