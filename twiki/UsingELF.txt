If you ever need to update your list of recipients for a TAR (Travel Request) or TES in the university ELF system, here's a small reminder, since it's not all that obvious:
<verbatim>

 Create a TAR or TES.
 Click "Change" by the "Send To" button. A new window will open. 
 Click "Remove All Users", then click "Add Addressee". 
 Under "Get all groups with names like" enter "Astronomy" then click "Search". 
 Click "Add this group". 
 Click "OK".

 Complete your TAR or TES to submit.

</verbatim>

is usually happens when there is a staff change. The ELF system doesn't do this automatically, but it knows who in Astronomy should be on that list.
