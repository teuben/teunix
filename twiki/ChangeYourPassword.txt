On the Linux computer network, the passwords from a master machine are distributed nightly to all computers. Therefore, to change your Linux password and have it distributed to all computers, you must log in to the master computer, terra, and change your password there. The command to change your password is <em>passwd. <br /></em>

If you change your password on any computer other than terra, it will get overwritten at 4am the following day with your old password. You <strong>must </strong>use terra to change your password for your password to stick.

Here are some links to help you choose a strong password:
