On the Linux computer network, the passwords from a master machine are distributed hourly to all computers. Therefore, to change your Linux password and have it distributed to all computers, you must log in to the master computer, terra.astro.umd.edu, and change your password there. The command to change your password is <em>passwd. <br /></em>

If you change your password on any computer other than terra, it will soon get overwritten with your old password. You <strong>must </strong>use terra to change your password for your password to stick.

Astronet password requirements:
   * must contain at least 3 of the 4 different character classes (upper case letters, lower case letters, digits, special characters)
   * must be at least 9 characters long (10 if only 3 character classes are used)
   * must not be close to a "dictionary" word (according to the computer's dictionary, not yours)
   * must not be "too close" to your previous password
