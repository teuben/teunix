To use spamassassin, edit your .forward file as stated in the EmailInfo page.

Then you just need to edit your .procmailrc file. An example (which is what I use) is provided [[http://www.astro.umd.edu/twiki/pub/AstroUMD/SpamAssassin/procmailrc-example][below]].

To give an example of how well it works, here are some statistics from my mail directory over a few months:
