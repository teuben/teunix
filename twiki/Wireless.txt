Since 17-aug-2023 new eduroam certificates are needed!<b><br /></b>

UMD faculty, staff and students can connect to wireless connections called '<b>eduroam</b>' using their UMDDirectory ID (use your full umd_name@umd.edu) and password. For more details see
[[https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011963][here]].
When you set up your WiFi, be sure to use PEAP for authentication, and MSCHAPv2 for Phase2 (Inner Authentication), domain wireless.umd.edu and the appropriate certificate. You can also visit https://setup.wireless.umd.edu to get your certificate manually. Once the certificate is downloaded, don't forget it may need to be installed manually! This could be a catch-22 situation if you cannot get to wireless. In that case the guest network '<b>umd-guest'</b> should be your rescue.

UPDATE 1-jan-2020: Guests should use the '<b>umd-guest</b>' SSID, and register. They will need a phone (SMS) or email to then finish the registration.

<span style="background-color: transparent;">UPDATE 23-aug-2017: A new campus guest wireless service is available: see </span><a href="https://go.umd.edu/guest-wifi" target="_blank" title="campus guest wifi">go.umd.edu/guest-wifi</a><span style="background-color: transparent;">. For now, the system described below still seems to be available, but it may go away without notice. The advantage of the system below is that authorization can be obtained for more than 1 day at a time, and does not require a personal device for activation.</span>

The old system to obtain a wireless account for a campus visitor, log into <a href="https://www.sims.umd.edu/" target="_blank">https://www.sims.umd.edu/</a> with your campus directory ID and password, then choose "Wireless" from the drop-down menu labeled "Select A System". Next click on the "Request" button, enter a description and expiration date, and click "Submit Create Request". The username and password for the guest account will be shown. The guest should then connect to the "umd-secure" wireless service, open a web browser, and enter the login information when prompted. The guest will then be able to access all web services normally accessible by campus users.
