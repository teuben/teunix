Here we remind seasoned linux/unix users about your astroumd account:
   1 The UMD [[Refresh2024]] will affect most of us.
   1 The *README.astronet* file in your home directory gives some specific hints
   1 Default *$SHELL* is /bin/bash, you will have received some dot-files from /local/skel
   1 The machine *terra.astro.umd.edu* should be used for account management (passwd, chsh, etc.) - they get propagated hourly
   1 Use the * *_local* files of your dot-files for local modifications
   1 *x2go* is our VNC, but we have an outstanding issue that it's not quite working for all mac users (linux and win OK)
   1 We keep an [[AstroNetDirectories]] table as a reminder where things are on the filesystem
   1 All directories (even local ones) should be addressed via the */n/diskname* construct. Although this means you can access any disk from any machine, please be careful about overloading the local NFS net traffic. Use the *df* command to check where a disk is mounted from.
   1 Most workstations have local disks that are much better to store data on, e.g. *chara* has */chara* and <b>/chara1nb </b>(the *nb* extension means it is not backed up)
