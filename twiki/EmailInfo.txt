The department's set of frequently-used exploders is located in */n/list/autogenerated/* and specialized exploders are located in /n/list/. You can view the files in these directories to see who is included in each exploder, or see below for notes about commonly-used exploders.

---++ <a name="Using_LDAP_to_find_addresses"></a> Using LDAP to find addresses

The University runs an LDAP server that contains contact information for almost everyone who has a UMD account. You can use it to look up email addresses, phone numbers, office locations, etc. Many mail clients support LDAP as a "Directory Service", and have differing configuration procedures. Here is the information needed; apply it to your situation.

The server name is ldap.umd.edu, and it requires authentication with your UMD account username. It uses the default port 389 with search base dc=umd,dc=edu and search scope Sub.
