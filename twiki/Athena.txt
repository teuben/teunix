Athena is a relative new, high-order Godunov MHD code developed by Jim Stone (Princeton University), Tom Gardiner (Cray Research), Main.PeterTeuben (University of Maryland), and John Hawley (University of Virginia).

It is in use by several people here and can be downloaded from [[http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~jstone/athena.html][this site]] at Princeton.

A plugin for the [[http://www.llnl.gov/visit/][VisIt]] graphics package for Athena output data is provided below.  It was written by Aaron Skinner and is provided under the same terms as <nop>VisIt.  AstroMake users don't need to do anything as this plugin is provided in the AstroMake install of <nop>VisIt.
