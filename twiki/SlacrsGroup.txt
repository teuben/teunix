---++ SLACRS Group
 This is an informal group of computing-interested people at UMD Astronomy Department. It has it's own web page at http://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/slacrs and the new defunct webpage Rob Swaters put up on http://www.robswork.net/masol

At the moment, the SLACRS Group appears to be no more; we are going on something like two years since the last meeting. However, the Theory Group has a weekly <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~perrine/theory_lunch.html">Theory Lunch</a> which is still active, has many of the people from the former SLACRS meetings, and frequently discusses software and computer issues.

Jonathan has been threatening to restart this group. Also note that incoming graduate students currently incoorporate some of the discussion items of the SLACRS group in their 695 course.
