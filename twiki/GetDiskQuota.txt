---++ How can I figure out my disk quota?

First of all, there are two disk quotas. One is for your main account, and another is for spare space.

*"Main" account space*

The path for this space is '/n/a/&lt;yourUserName&gt;' (or perhaps a1, a2, or a3). This is located on the "Earth" computer.

Quota: 1 GB (as of 10/20/08)

*"Spare" space*

The path to access this disk space is '/n/b/&lt;yourUserName&gt;'. It is located on "Virgo".

Quota: ~3GB (as of 10/20/08)

*Checking your usage:*

1. Log into the relevant computer (Earth or Virgo). Eg: "slogin Earth"

2. Type "quota"

3. Understand the output.

You only need to look at columns 2-4. These numbers are all in kB (divide by 1000 for MB, etc).

blocks = user's current disk usage

quota = first warning (When your "blocks" exceeds this, you need to delete files.)

limit = absolute limit (If your "blocks" is close to this, the machines won't let you write ANYTHING -- bad news)
