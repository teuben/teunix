---++ Subversion in the Astronomy Department
[[http://subversion.tigris.org][Subversion]] is a version control system designed to replace CVS.
It is often used as a repository for source code.
There is ample online documentation, including a book: http://svnbook.red-bean.com
A few groups in the Astronomy department are using Subversion to host different projects.
[[http://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/svn/svn-simple.html][here]] is a very simple example how to use
SVN for your own personal project.


---+++ Dynamics Group
Derek is using a Subversion repository to hold the source code of =pkdgrav= and various related tools.
The Subversion clients are installed in AstroMake, and the server is running under Apache on the machine =riemann.astro.umd.edu=.
The notes from this installation are in =~gwl/Projects/reconcile_pkdgrav/subversion_notes=.
This installation required root/boss access.

The repository can be accessed by any web browser at http://riemann.astro.umd.edu/viewvc
This interface is an add-on program that provides access to past revisions, history, and log messages.

To use this repository to work on =pkdgrav= or related programs in =ss_core=, read the instructions in =~gwl/Projects/reconcile_pkdgrav/pkdgrav_with_subversion=.
