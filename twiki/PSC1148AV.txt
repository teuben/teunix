---++ Troubleshooting
   * *No video feed from the room's camera:* Try starting (or quitting and restarting) Skype on the room computer. You can then quit Skype and use a different video program if you wish. (The capture card goes into some kind of sleep mode, and Skype seems to be the only thing that can wake it up.)
   * <strong>Phone has no dial tone: </strong>It sometimes works to reboot the phone by unplugging it and replugging it, though the boot process takes a couple of minutes.
   * <strong>Wireless mouse and keyboard aren't working: </strong>Make sure they're turned on. Check the CRESTRON touchscreen; it has a 'USB Source' button that controls whether the mouse and keyboard are working with the room PC or the room Mac Mini.
   * _A reboot of the PC can sometimes fix problems._
