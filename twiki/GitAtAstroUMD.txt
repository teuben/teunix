<strong>git </strong>is a software repository originally written by Linus Torvalds, the author and maintainer of Linux.
The git is present on the Department of Astronomy linux computers as a part of Scientific Linux 6.<br /><br />
This is not a tutorial on the git but just a quick note on what has been done in the astronomy department to support the use of the git.
For a tutorial, read the documentation at http://git-scm.com/doc (I strongly suggest reading Chapters 2 and 3).
For reference you can also read the man pages on the system.<br /><br />
Normally one will work on some program in a personal git copy, usually kept in a place like your home directory, and then clone it to a public place. A public place for these repositories has been set up at /n/www/git. Create a directory for yourself in /n/www/git/user (where _user_ is your username) and clone your repository inside that directory. The repository should be<br />a _bare_ repository with just the git files and should end with the suffix _.git_. An example command to create this public repository clone is:
<pre><verbatim>   git clone --bare /n/www/git/user/myproject.git</verbatim></pre>

This assumes your current directory is in your private repository, your project is named _myproject_, and _user_ is your username.
 For a group of people using a common public repository, a system administrator can set up the permissions to make that possible.
 Then, rather than one's username, the directory in which the repository is located can be whatever name the group decides to use.
<br /><br />
A list of all repositories that are currently in the public git area can be seen at http://www.astro.umd.edu/git .
<br /><br />
Git repositories can be accessed with different protocols.
The git protocols are described in
<br/>
 http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols .
<br /><br />
For private repositories, two protocols are supported, local and ssh. 
Both reading and writing are supported.<br /><br />
For the public git area, an additional two protocols are available, git and http/https. Both of these protocols are read-only.
<br /><br />
A url to the public git area using various protocols might look like one of the following:
  <table>
  <tr><td>local</td>  <td> /n/www/git/user/myproject.git</td></tr>
   <tr><td>or</td>     <td>file: ///n/www/git/myproject.git</td></tr>
   <tr><td>ssh</td>  <td>//user@gaia/www/git/user/myproject.git</td></tr>
   <tr><td>or</td>     <td>ssh://gaia/www/git/user/myproject.git</td></tr>
   <tr><td>http</td>  <td>http://git/user/myproject.git</td></tr>
   <tr><td>git</td>    <td>git://user/myproject.git</td></tr>
  </table>
Again, substitute the name of your project for _myproject_ and your own username for _user_.

For the http protocol to work right after creating the public repository by cloning, run these commands:
<pre><verbatim> 
   cd /n/www/git/user/myproject.git
   cd hooks
   cp post-update.sample post-update
</verbatim></pre>
If this is not done, then commands that use the http protocol may not work correctly.
