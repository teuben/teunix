---+ Bringing your laptop to ASTRO/UMD

UMD is nothing more than your ISP, though you will be able to print. If you have an account on astro.umd, a few more services are available.

   * WiFi is eduroam or umd-guest
   * Ethernet is on our local astronet IP: 10.225.25.xxx (ATL) or 10.225.24.xxx (PSC), anybody can connect via DHCP.
   * Printing will work from wifi as well as ethernet, but you may need to install your own drivers
   * Workstations (redhat 8) you can connect to via ssh. Use "ssh astro.umd.edu" as landing point
   * Copying/Syncing files can be done via rsync or mounting disks using sshfs
   *
