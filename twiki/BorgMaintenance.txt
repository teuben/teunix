---++ Borg Maintenance
This page describes a few aspects of how the Borg runs, that may need to be tweaked from time to time.

---+++ Tape Backups
The Queen runs the Amanda tape backup software and uses the attached 4-tape drive.
Only the Queen's disk array (0.5TB, mounted as =/a1= and =/net=) is backed up, and we have not tried retrieving anything from backup in a long time.
*You rely on this backup system at your own peril!*
Derek gets emails from Amanda whenever the tapes need to be changed.
This process is quite simple, the tapes are numbered and kept in small boxes on top of the wire rack in the computing room.
	1 Press the "Eject" button on the tape drive.  It may take 2-3 minutes to eject.
	1 Hold the tape release (bottom left, when looking at the tape carriage face-on) and remove the tapes.
	1 Take new tapes out of their plastic cases, put old tapes in, put cases in appropriate boxes.
	1 Insert new tapes into carriage (order is irrelevant).  Gently shake to make sure the tapes are all held in correctly.
	1 Replace carriage in drive, tape end facing out (push in until mechanism takes it).

---+++ Ganglia Monitoring
The Borg runs the [[http://ganglia.sourceforge.net][Ganglia]] cluster monitoring suite.  This consists of a daemon on each node that multicasts statistics to a head daemon running on the Queen.  The statistics can be seen at http://borg.astro.umd.edu/ganglia/.

The notes taken during the installation of Ganglia are in =~gwl/programs/ganglia_notes=.
On each node (including the queen) the daemon =gmond= is set to start on boot.
On the Queen, the daemon =gmetad= is also running.
A set of PHP scripts in =/usr/local/apache/htdocs/ganglia= reads the Ganglia info and generates the web interface.

Because the Queen has several network cards, we need to specially direct the =gmond= daemon on the Queen to use the right interface.  Unfortunately, this must be done every time the Queen is rebooted, or else its statistics will not be collected by Ganglia.
Whenever the Queen is rebooted, as root, execute the following command: =/sbin/route add -host 239.2.11.71 dev eth2=.  This manually alters the routing table to make multicasts go through the gigabit card that is internal to the cluster.

---+++ Locutus Accounts
Locutus is currently the large disk (1.5TB, not backed up!) for the Borg cluster.
Unlike the compute nodes, Locutus uses its own local installation of Linux, including the details of user accounts.
This means that having an account on the Borg does not automatically give you access to the large disk of Locutus.
To make permissions work, a user's account on Locutus must use the same user-id as the account on the Borg.
To create a new, working account on Locutus, as root:
	1 Find the username and user-id from =/etc/passwd= on the Borg (first and third columns).
	1 On Locutus, create a new account with =useradd -u (Borg user-id) -p (new temporary password) (username)=
	1 Tell the user the temporary password, tell them to change it.
If you have already created an account, you can change the user-id with an option to the command =usermod=.
