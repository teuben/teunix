---++ Printing Information
---++++ The Printers

We use the [[http://www.cups.org][Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)]] to manage printers on the Astronomy network. To view available printers, see SummaryOfCurrentPrinters.

Better up to date is to browse printers via [[http://localhost:631/printers]] where you may need to replace "localhost" with your actual workstation name.

All our printers can be printed to from the either the Astronomy wired network <i>astro.umd.edu </i>or the wireless (eduroam) network <i>umd.edu. <br /></i>

---++++ Adding Printers
---++++++ Mac Machines

   1 Find the printer you want to add via SummaryOfCurrentPrinters.
   1 Open your Mac's System Preferences and select Printers & Scanners.
   1 Click the "+" button to add a printer and select the "IP" method. This should have the icon of a globe)
   1 Under Address, enter the full address of the printer (e.g., astropmailc.astro.umd.edu).
   1 Wait for the interface to autocomplete the fields.
   1 Protocol should preferably be LPD.
   1 Optionally give your printer a name (e.g., astropmailc) and location (e.g., PSC 1113).
   1 Click "Add" and the printer should be ready for your jobs.
   1 Warning: preferably pick a printer via an IP protocol, not DNS-SD.
---++++++ Windows Machines

As with most things 'windows' this is not the easiest process, but with a little bit of work, the network printer of your choice can be added. NOTE: These instructions are for Win 7 machines, the steps for the other windows machines are similar if not the same.

   1 Start ==&gt; Settings ==&gt; Devices ==&gt; Printers & Scanners ==&gt; Add a printer
   1 ==&gt; The printer I want isn't listed
   1 ==&gt; Add a printer using an IP address or hostname
   1 ==&gt; Device type: IPP Device (or use Autodetect if that fails)

Do not share your printer, unless you know what you are doing.

---++++++ Linux Machines

The department Linux computers are set up to print to any printer. You can use "lpr -P<em>printername" </em>or set the $PRINTER environment variable in your shell.

For personal Ubuntu machines, you can try and self-discover, and pick the appropriate driver.

Otherwise, from System Settings -&gt; Add printer -&gt; LPD/LPR Host of Printer -&gt; Add IP address, or full network name (e.g. bima2.astro.umd.edu) of printer from SummaryOfCurrentPrinters and leave the Queue blank. Usually a generic Postscript printer works, but again, an appropriate driver might give some benefits.

When you select a protocol, be sure to pick something that uses the IP (should be a 10.225.24.x or 10.225.25.x number), and not the DNS-SD (bonjour self-discovery) protocol. They will not work with the UMD DNS, as well as can cause issues if you use VPN from home. See also our HowToUseVPN page.
