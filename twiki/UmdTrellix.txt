---+ Trelix

Trellix (formerly known as FireEye Endpoint Security) is a modern endpoint protection (antivirus) software that can detect and prevent malicious digital threats that infiltrate our devices before they spread to our most critical data.

By default, Trellix Endpoint includes several firewall rules to allow the most commonly used inbound connections.

History: In 2022, Symphony Technology Group (STG) acquired McAfee Enterprise and FireEye and rebranded them as Trellix.
