---+ Mail Forwarding Examples

Say you have a department account, _me@astro.umd.edu_ and you want to forward things to another account at _me@home.net_. Also, assume that your astro mailbox is stored on _myMailHost._

---+++ With .forward File

The simplest way to do this is with a *.forward* file in your department home directory. If you don't already have one, go ahead and create one and put this line in it:

<blockquote><verbatim>me@home.net</verbatim></blockquote>

This will forward all your _astro.umd.edu_ mail directly to your _home.net_ account. If you want to save a copy in your _astro.umd.edu_ account as well, put this instead:

<blockquote><verbatim>me@home.net,me@myMailHost.astro.umd.edu</verbatim></blockquote>

Yes, you can list more than one forwarding address - just separate them with commas. If your mailbox is on earth (like most people), this would be:

<blockquote><verbatim>me@home.net,me@earth.astro.umd.edu</verbatim></blockquote>

If your *.forward* file already contains a line that looks like this:

<blockquote><verbatim>"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -t -f- || exit 75 #me"</verbatim></blockquote>

you can still add forwarding address lines before and after this _procmail_ invocation line.

---+++ With .procmailrc

If you are running a <em>procmail</em>-based spam filter, you can edit the *.procmailrc* file in your home directory rather than your *.forward* file, so you can take advantage of spam filtering to avoid forwarding unwanted messages. Your *.procmailrc* file probably already contains the lines you need, commented out. Try searching for ":0c:". If you find it, uncomment the lines and edit the email address accordingly. If you don't find it, you'll need to type a few extra letters. Either way the result will look something like this:

<blockquote><verbatim>:0c: ! me@home.net</verbatim></blockquote>

(That's a zero - not an uppercase "O".) Put this command after your filtering recipes to avoid forwarding spam (an extremely good idea). This recipe clones the message - keeping a copy at _astro.umd.edu_ as well as forwarding a copy to _home.net_.

---+++ NOTE

In order for forwarding to work, your home directory must be accessible and the *.forward* or *.procmailrc* file must be world-readable.

---+++ WARNING

You should carefully avoid setting up mail forwarding loops (i.e., _me@astro.umd.edu_ forwards to _me@home.net_ which forwards to _me@astro.umd.edu_). I know, it sounds like fun, but while most mail handlers will recognize the loop and cut off the fun relatively quickly, one dumb mail handler could cause a fair amount of grief. Also, putting _me@astro.umd.edu_ in your .forward file creates a forwarding loop if your mailbox is located somewhere other than earth.astro.umd.edu.
