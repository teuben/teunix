*How to set up your course email list in Google Groups*

The university discontinued the UMEG coursemail system in summer 2019 and started a new course email system in Google Groups. Like with the previous coursemail system, this new course email system should automatically update membership when students add/drop the course. (Please note that the messaging application contained with Canvas is still functioning and available.)

   * _Setting up your course email list._ 
      * IT's article on this is reasonably good - see the first section of this webpage: [[https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport?id=kb_article_view&article=KB0014902][Create and Manage Coursemail Lists with the ELMS Management Tool]].
      * Note that you will give your email list a "display name". In my screenshot image, the display name of my email list is "astr498-fall2019". <img width="947" alt="" src="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~avondale/display-name.png" height="949" />
   * _Checking permissions for the email list._ 
      * You can manage the list through Google groups. Login to your UMD Google account (i.e., your @umd.edu account) and click the apps button to look through the apps and find the "Groups" app. Once you click on that, you'll see a button for "My Groups", and you should click that.
      * Now you will see a text list of the Google groups you are a member of; the new course email list/group that you just made should be listed. The display should be similar to this screenshot.<img alt="" src="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~avondale/my-groups.png" />
      * <em>Check roles. </em>If you click on the small blue "manage members" link, you will get a list of everyone in the group. Make sure that you are listed as a "manager". As I write this, I don't have TAs listed for my course yet, but I assume they will also be "managers".
      * <em>Check posting permissions. </em>On the left side menu, under "permissions", click "posting permissions". Make sure that managers and members (i.e., students) have the posting permissions that you desire. If you want to make this list like a UMEG coursemail list, then only "managers" should be able to send emails/posts. The last option of "reply to author" has a default value of none, so I changed that to "all members of the group", because if I send an email to my students, I want the students to be able to reply to me.
   * _Sending emails to the students in the course._ 
      * <em>Via Google groups. </em>If you are in Google groups, you can post directly to the group - a "post" will be an email sent out to the students (or they can view it via their Google groups page). IT has a webpage describing this: [[https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport?id=kb_article&article=KB0014977][Send Messages to a Coursemail Group]]. (Note: when you are changing group permissions, under the "information" heading and "general information" sub-heading, there is an option to turn off web posting. That means group members can only post by email. In that case, you can't send emails to the group via Google groups. Use the next option.)
      * <em>Via Gmail browser. </em>If you are in the Gmail browser (not connected through another app, such as Thunderbird or pine), you can email to the "display name" of the group. In my example in the top screenshot, my email list display name was "astr498-fall2019". I could type that into the "To:" line in my Gmail browser, and Google will know which group the email should be send to.
      * _Via a non-Gmail email reader._ If you are reading email through another app, such as Thunderbird or pine, IT will tell you that you can't email to the course email list. But I have figured out how you can. 
         * From "My Groups" in Google groups, click on the small blue "manage group" option. This should send you to the "general information" page of the group, which should look similar to the screenshot below.<img alt="" src="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~avondale/email-name.png" />
         * You will see that "group email address" is greyed out because you are not allowed to change it. This is the literal email address for your group. For my group in the screenshot, it is "201908-astr498-1jcybvl92d5d9fd-b11d-f4dc-4cf832dac@umd.edu". Unfortunately you can't highlight this address to copy-paste it, so carefully type it out somewhere so that you CAN copy-paste it. Then paste it into your email browser and you can email to it directly. (Assuming that you are emailing from your @umd.edu account.)
