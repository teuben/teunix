AstroNet is the generic name for the network of astronomy computers at UMD.

We keep a page AstroNetDirectories if you are curious where some of the directories are that we keep in "non-standard" places.

We have an AstroUMD101 page too, a very short reminder on the peculiarities of our system, from the point of view of an experienced unix user
