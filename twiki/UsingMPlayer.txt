---++ Using MPlayer
[[http://www.mplayerhq.hu][MPlayer]] is a media player program.
Its key feature is the ability to play just about any format of movie you can find.
This includes plain old MPEGs, newer <nop>DivXs, and Quicktime.
It also includes a movie encoder that is very useful for creating small, portable movies from a sequence of image frames.

---+++ Installing
MPlayer is available via AstroMake, do an =astroload mplayer=
It is only available on Linux machines.

---+++ Playing movies
To watch a movie, simply do =mplayer movie_filename=.
Hit the =f= key to toggle fullscreen, and use the arrow keys to seek within the movie.
You can also pass =mplayer= a URL to play directly from the web.

_A note about warnings_: =mplayer= and =mencoder= spit out several messages that look like errors, but are really just informational.
You can safely ignore warnings about 'No such file or directory' for config files and font info and 'Linux RTC init error' stuff.
When encoding, =mencoder= will tell you that 'frameno.avi' couldn't be found; again, you can ignore this.

Web pages often embed movies, instead of providing a direct link to download them.
While this works on Windows, it infuriates Linux users.
To view these movies, get your browser to show you the source of the web page.
Then search for the embedded movie (searching for =.mov= or =.avi= will usually work).
Copy the full link (often provided as the =src= or =href= attribute to an =embed= tag) and point =mplayer= at it.
	* Movie trailers are often released in Quicktime format on the Apple website http://www.apple.com/trailers/  These can be played on Linux with a little work.  Choose the particular trailer you want and the movie size.  Then view the page source and find the link to the movie (search for =.mov=).  You want the one that has a number at the end of the filename (it represents the width of the movie).  Take that URL, and put a lower-case =m= in front of the number.  That's the full URL to the real movie file, which you can download or pass directly to =mplayer=.

---+++ Making movies
To create a movie from a sequence of frames, use the encoding tool of MPlayer, =mencoder=.
The encoder can read JPEG and PNG formats.
If your frames are in another format, use the ImageMagickTools to convert them.
All frames must be the same size and must use true color, i.e. not a color palette.
You can verify this using =identify frame.png=: if it says =<nop>PseudoClass= it's a paletted image, you want it to say =<nop>DirectClass=.

You need to name your frames such that a glob of the filenames will produce the desired sequence of frames.
For example, =frame001.jpeg, frame002.jpeg, frame003.jpeg, ...= will be found by the glob =frame*.jpeg=.

Finally, create your movie with a command like:
<pre>mencoder "mf://frame*.jpeg" -fps 10 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4 -o my_movie.avi</pre>
This creates a movie called =my_movie.avi= that is composed of the frames found by the glob =frame*.jpeg= played at 10 frames per second, encoded using the (default) MPEG4 video format.  Substitute the values you want.  The =mf://= business is a URL-like descriptor that lets the encoder know the input source is a sequence of files, specified by the glob you provide.  =lavc= is the name of the library used to do the encoding.  It supports all sorts of technical options that most people should ignore; look in the man page for details.

---++++ Codecs
=mencoder= can create movies using a variety of codecs, by supplying different values of the =vcodec= parameter.
=mplayer= can show all of the formats that =mencoder= can create.
Creating movies that can be played on Windows can be tricky; You should try all three codecs listed here and see which works for you.
If you're going to use a movie in a talk, *always, every time, no exceptions, TEST* the movie you make on the machine you're going to use for the talk.
You'll probably want to use either =mpeg4=, =msmpeg4v2=, or =wmv2=.
	* =mpeg4= is a form of the <nop>DivX codec, which usually produces the highest-quality, smallest file-size movies.  These movies can sometimes be played on Windows if the user has a recent version of Windows Media Player.  Alternatively, they may have to manually install the <nop>DivX codec from www.divx.com  Mac OS X users can use [[http://mplayerosx.sourceforge.net][MPlayer for OS X]].
	* =msmpeg4v2= is another version of the <nop>DivX codec.  These movies can usually be played on Windows using the default install of Windows Media Player.
	* =wmv2= (stands for Windows Media Video) is a Microsoft-specified format.  These movies can sometimes be played on Windows using the default install of Windows Media Player.

---++++ Working on a Sun
If you are using a Sun, you need to remotely login to a Linux machine to use =mencoder=.
If you try to play a movie over the remote connection, it will work but be slow and the colors will be messed up.
The movie itself has the correct colors, it is the different X servers that produce the color difference.
This problem can be avoided in two ways.
	1 Copy the movie to a Linux or Windows machine and view it there.
	2 *Stop using a Sun, you hippie!*
