---++ You old astro.umd.edu email

Please note this section will disappear by Summer 2020, if not sooner. Officially astro email will not work after March 20, 3pm.

   1 Create a new mail account, e.g. via _File-&gt;New-&gt;Mail Account_. Fill out the name, email address (should be <em>user</em>@astro.umd.edu, where _user_ is your username) , and password . You can opt to remember this password. Click on "Continue" for the selection of incoming and outgoing servers.
   1 The incoming server should be *mailhost.astro.umd.edu*. Select *IMAP* unless it does not work for you as it has tighter security than POP3. IMAP port number should be *143*, and select *Start TLS*. Do not select the secure authentication button, this will not work.
   1 The outgoing server is also *mailhost.astro.umd.edu*. For the port number, use 587 and select *Start TLS*.
You might at some point be prompted for a password. And you might get prompted for a certificate. Just accept that, although we don't have a true certificate, and thunderbird will probably complain about that, but after that, you should be able to send and receive email. You might also have to quit thunderbird and come back in, or switch to another account and restart this new account. Some users have complained it didn't work for them, but then at some point amazingly it suddenly just worked...

Please remember we don't recommend setting this up again, as your astro.umd.edu account will be remapped to the campus wide umd.edu google mail based system. Your old email probably lives in ~/Mail and ~/f. You inbox will be on /n/mail/$USER, all in mbox format.
---++ Your new (2020) umd email

On March 20, 2020 (but now corona-delayed) your astro.umd.edu email will be remapped to your official umd.edu email. I have recently set up my thunderbird client with umd.edu, and followed the guidelines posted at https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0015113 (search for: _Use Thunderbird for UMD Email_ in case the link goes stale)

Note: do <strong>NOT </strong>enter your password on the initial setup screen, or OAuth setup will fail; wait until it asks you for it later on in the setup. Otherwise the instructions worked fine with me.

This is version 2 of their document, and it describes (for Win and Mac) the OAuth2 method, which worked for me on Linux. The older document described the "app password" method, and was considerably more complex. But it did work. Just make sure you don't have an entry with the same IMAP/SMTP server, you will need to modify it to make thunderbird allow your new entry.

<span style="background-color: transparent;">For the ASTRO users were given an option to migrate their mailboxes. I will attempt to summarize issues around this, as I chose for this options. My opinions may evolve over time as I learn more from others</span>

   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">Your astro INBOX will be merged into your umd INBOX. I would advice to clean up both your INBOX and file them into folders (on astro), and on umd perhaps "archive" everything.</span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">In retrospect it would have been wiser to copy your astro mailboxes (not your INBOX though) manually to your umd account instead of having them do it.</span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">Unsubscribe from the "Gmail/All Mail" box, it can be big, and will hyjack your thunderbird (can become cpu and memory hog this way). It covers all your folders, so you don't need it. It would also duplicate your drive space.</span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">Regularly empty the trash and compact folders, as G-suite does not seem to advertise basic cleanup very well. Or just wait the 30 days they use to remove trash?</span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">Gmail labels are hierchical, you will find them in e.g. Mail-Nemo-rotcur, which came from your Mail/Nemo/rotcur mailbox file (which some call a folder)</span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">There is a useful plugin for thunderbird called "Gmail Buttons", which also shows the gmail labels to an email</span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">The Archives folder works for me in UMD's gmail, but not in GMAIL itself. This is tricky, as this means in gmail it will go to "All Mail", which you want to unsubscribe from. But when you archive, it will subscribe again. Bug?</span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;"><br /></span>
A few items I find very useful in thunderbird:

   1 sort a mailbox by many things, size being one (try that in gmail)
   1 move a mail (or selection, or whole folders) transparently between mail servers
   1 pick which folders you want on the hard drive, the so-called subscribe. also useful to check old emails off-line
   1 easy to find your mail app when you have too many browsers and tabs open (some browsers have good tab managers)
   1 "Loading..."
And let's be honest, or at least let me jot down some things I don't like:

   1 Unsubscribing from the "All Mail" means it becomes a little harder to search for an email
   1 The "Archive" button in GMAIL seems to auto-subscribe to the "All Mail". UMD account does not have this for me, as it has an "Archives" folder

And last but not least, there are a few useful plugins in Thunderbird that you might find useful:

   1 Lightning:  this allows integration of calendar gmail. You can also convert an email to an event via the "message right click" -&gt; Convert to
   1 Google Provider: this adds buttons so you can Archive and Delete more easily (i found I sometimes need ot restart thunderbird if they don't show up)
