---++ Using the Evolution email/contact/calendar application
Evolution is a personal imformation management application using Gnome on Linux.
It provides functionality similar to Outlook on Windows.
It is available on the version of Mandrake Linux the department has installed.

---+++ Configuring for the Astronomy mail spool
This description is for the preferences tabs under =Tools-&gt;Mail Settings ...=, choosing =Edit=.
First use =Add= to create the account via a wizard, which will ask the same questions.

Under =Receiving Mail=, choose =Server Type: Standard Unix mbox spools= and specify your personal spool location =/var/spool/mail/{username}= 

Under =Receiving Options= you probably want to enable automatic checking with a reasonable interval.

For =Sending Mail=, choose =Server Type: SMTP= with host =mailhost.astro.umd.edu=.
Check the boxes for =Use secure connection (SSL)= and =Server requires authentication=.
Choose =Authentication Type: Password= and supply your username.
Personal choice on =Remember this password=.

Under =Special Folders= you can specify where drafts and sent messages go.
This can be useful to coordinate between different email clients that, by default, put such messages in different places.

---+++ Configuring for UMD IMAP mail
Under =Receiving Mail=, choose =Server Type: IMAP= and specify the host =mail.umd.edu= and supply your username (note, your UMD and Astronomy usernames may be different, here use your UMD account username).
Enable =Use secure connection (SSL)= and choose =Authentication Type: Password=.
Personal choice on =Remember this password=.

Under =Receiving Options= do NOT enable =Show only subscribed folders= or =Override server-supplied folder namespace=.

For =Sending Mail=, use the Astronomy department SMTP server, described above.
