---+ Overview

These TWiki pages are intended to be an evolving repository of knowledge related to the Deparment of Astronomy (of the University of Maryland at College Park) computing network. All members of the Department (with an astro.umd.edu account) can edit these pages. You may also want to visit the main [[http://www.astro.umd.edu/][Astronomy web site]] for general information about the Department.

This page is primarily intended for people who are new to the department or are using the department's computer network for the first time.

%TOC%
---++ Astronomy Computing

Members of the Department generally have their own machines, often both a desktop and a laptop (or more than one of either or both!). The Department provides full support for desktops running Linux (Red Hat Enterprise currently), partial or qualified support for desktops running Windows or Mac OS X, and limited support for laptops. There are centralized resources available, including disk storage, e-mail support, a webserver, standard and specialized software, a cluster computing platform, and a visualization lab. The Department also provides access to and maintains various types of peripheral hardware, such as printers. A comprehensive backup system with tape redundancy is in place. Gigabit networking (and wireless throughout the buildings) is provided by the campus Division of Information Technology (DIT).

During the Fall 2019 we transitioned to a new version (Centos7) of Linux. Those used to the old system should consult the [[https://www.astro.umd.edu/transition.html][transition guide]],

In 2021/22 we transitioned to Redhat8.6

Here are the AstroNetDirectories, also comparing some common directories between other unix systems such as your laptop.

   * Main.AnneRaugh (research faculty): oversees computing needs in the Small Bodies group.
---++ Astronomy Computing Committee

The department has a standing Astronomy Computer Committee (ACC) that sets policies related to computing, is responsible for short- and long-term planning, makes proposals for new spending, acts as liaison with [[http://www.it.umd.edu][UM Division of IT]], and responds to users' needs where appropriate. The committee has representation from all department stakeholders, including graduate students. The ACC 2021/22 committee is

   * &lt;vacant&gt;, Chair
   * Olivia Dent
   * Alexander Dittmann, grad student representative
   * Marc Pound
   * Kevin Rauch (actiing chair)
   * Anne Raugh
   * Xi Shao
   * Peter Teuben
   * Dennis Wellnitz
   * Mark Wolfire (rotates off)
If you have issues, concerns, and/or ideas related to computing in our department, please contact any member of the ACC. We'll be happy to hear from you! You can also consult the mailing list in */n/list/acc*
---++ I'm new here&mdash;what do I do?

The <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/resources/internal/deptsupport.html#computers">Department Support</a> webpage includes information such as getting a department computer account, getting a university computer account, getting a temporary wireless account, and who to see if you have questions or problems. (See also "Personnel" above.) . Remember in general your astro.umd.edu account will be different from your campus umd.edu account. Department computers for one, Campus wide things (e.g. wireless) for the other.
---++ What is Linux?

Linux is based on Unix and is an operating system similar to Windows and macOS. Many Windows applications, such as Microsoft Office, do not exist on Linux, but there are frequently equivalent alternatives (see [[Using Open Office]]). Most department members use Linux computers, while a significant population uses Macs, as macOS is also based on Unix. (However, the department does not currently provide support for Macs.)

Many modern Linux applications include graphical user interfaces in windows. However, a lot of work is still done in Linux using text commands in a _terminal window_. These commands can be surprisingly powerful. An internet search for "Unix commands" or "Unix tutorial" should give you a good introduction to working with files and directories, printing, connecting to other machines, etc. Help for these commands can also be found by typing "man &lt;command&gt;" or "info &lt;command&gt;", as well as the "--help" option to the command. Commands that start frequently used programs include google-chrome or firefox (browsers), libreoffice ("office" software), acroread (Acrobat Reader), gimp (image editing), vi, gedit or emacs (text editing), etc. Various astronomy software packages are also available, such as iraf, idl/idlde, casa, and ds9. See also [[Software Map]].

The University of Florida's astronomy department has a very good <a href="http://www.astro.ufl.edu/it/handbook/">introduction to Linux in a scientific environment</a>. Much of the material in Sections II, IV, and V is valid for our computer system as well.
---++ Connecting to department computers

Our computer network allows users to connect to other computers within the department using the ssh command, e.g., "ssh earth". You can also connect to department computers from <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/resources/internal/ssh/"> a computer at home or otherwise outside the network</a>. For more details, see [[Remote Access]]. We maintain a list of [[Public Workstations]]. You will need your astro.umd.edu account for this.The magic command to find resources on the astronet machines is *astro-admin*
---++ Connecting to campus wireless

UMD provides wireless access points all over campus. The preferred networks to use are umd-guest or eduroam. For more information, visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://connect.umd.edu/" title="campus wireless info page">campus wireless info page</a>.

In brief: eduroam is the best to use, since it should also magically work when you are visiting partner universities. OIT has many resources how to do this, including a secret sauce script that does all the hard work for you. But you can probably bypass this as long as you know the following setups that are now (Jun 2022) required:<br /><br /> EAP= *PEAP* Phase2= *MSCHAPv2* domain= *wireless.umd.edu* certificate= **.pem* id= *YOUR_UMD_NAME@umd.edu* passwd= *YOUR_LDAP_PASSWD*

The certificate is attached at the bottom of this page, it's good until 2031. There are however conflicting reports if/when the certificate is needed. Try it without, if it doesn't work, add it.

An additional case occured where even these steps did not work, but restricting the connection to a specific wireless device then made it work. Somehow the difficult cases were all on Dell laptops, where Lenovo laptops worked out of the box without even a certificate.

---++ What happens when I leave?

Old user accounts pose security risks. They are also a drain on resources. Therefore, we disable all old accounts 3 months after a user has left. After 6 months the username is deleted. Files located on a public disk (/n/a, /n/b, or [[Public Workstations]]) will be deleted, or if retention of data is required, the user must make arrangements with a local user who will agree to store the data in their own account under their own username (since the old username will be deleted). Files left on a private computer can remain but will need to have permissions reset to the local user. Mail is NOT forwarded after the account is disabled (this eliminates the risk of forwarding spam).<br /><br />Exceptions to this policy may be considered, but generally will require that the user of the account in question either be on the university's payroll, or be specifically named as a participant on a currently funded grant held by a local user, and need regular access to local machines and/or data.

If you have any questions, please contact the chair of the Astronomy Computer Committee.
