---++ Remote Access

If you have an account to access the department Linux computers, you can login from your laptop or home PC, connected on any network. If you are off-campus, however, most department machines (aside from <b>astro.umd.edu </b>and *terra.astro.umd.edu*) will _not_ be visible unless you connect to campus VPN first; see HowToUseVPN. When ready to login, open a terminal window and type

=ssh -XY &lt;yourAstroID&gt;@&lt;computerName&gt;.astro.umd.edu=

(For basic terminal logins, the -XY flags can be omitted.) You will be prompted for your ASTRO password, after which you will be connected to the machine. We maintain a list of [[Public Workstations]] where you can pick your &lt;computerName&gt; from; for the most up-to-date listing, run the command <strong> =host-info public= </strong>on any of our Linux machines.

SSH keys provide a secure alternative way to login to your account. To add one to your account, you first create a private/public key pair on the computer (laptop or home PC) from which you will login, then add the public key to the file =~/.ssh/authorized_keys= in your ASTRO home directory (an admin can install the public key if you do not currently have login access). On MacOS or Linux, create a key pair by running this command in a terminal window:
<verbatim>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <yourAstroID>@astro.umd.edu -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</verbatim>

Set a good passphrase to protect your private key. Then login to your account as above (via password), edit the *astro* file =~/.ssh/authorized_keys= and add the *contents* of the public key file on your *laptop/PC* =~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub= to it. The public key will be a _single_ line of text ending in your comment =&lt;yourAstroID&gt;@astro.umd.edu=. Subsequent logins from your laptop/PC should now use the SSH key (and its passphrase) by default instead of asking for your astro account password.

On Windows, you can install the [[https://www.bitvise.com][Bitvise SSH client]] and create an ECDSA key pair as described here: [[https://www.bitvise.com/getting-started-public-key-bitvise]], then add the PUBLIC key to your astro account as described in their "Upload public key" sub-section (or export the public key in OpenSSH format as explained in the "Export public key" sub-section, and install it manually as described above).
