---++ Remote Access

If you have an account to access the department computers, you can do so from your laptop too, connected on any network. Open a Terminal and type

=ssh -XY &lt;yourAstroID&gt;@&lt;computerName&gt;.astro.umd.edu=

You will be prompted for your ASTRO password. Upon entering it, you will be connected to the machine. We maintain a list of [[Public Workstations]] where you can pick your computerName from. Use the command <strong> =host-info public= </strong>for this.
