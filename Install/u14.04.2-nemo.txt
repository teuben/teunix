Installed Mar 5, on T61p - "cloned" info from my T530

during installation I picked /dev/sdc (the 64G boot device) as where
to install the boat loader....  but next boot it still went back to
old one.... maybe that one was on the HD (sda).

Running update-grub in the old u14.04 fixed this, I now have a
grub.cfg file that points also to sdc2 with u14.10

The following packages were added using:

    sudo apt-get install <NAME>

some are essential for development, others to sustain my old/bad habits.

Also google around, e.g.
  www.webupd8.org/2014/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu.html
  www.noobslab.com/2014/04/thingstweeaks-to-do-after-install-of.html
  itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-14-04/
  www.enqlu.com/2014/03/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu.html


for 14.10 I also noticed a few new ones:

First time login, there is a warning about a new language being used, and i
get the option to change  'Templates' and 'Public', this was the cause of
some trouble about missing data/time in top bar.

Also to advice, before you start

     dpkg --list > dpkg1.list

and repeat this at the end.

Here are the packages:

=  emacs
=  build-essential      (gcc 4.9.1)
=  gfortran
=  cmake
=  ruby                 (eventually to fix sshmenu - no go on that one)
=  tcsh       
  chromium-browser 
  pidgin

then "chsh" and login again with tcsh (skip that if you want to keep bash login)

  digikam
  khelpcenter4 
=  systemsettings                   (KDE System Settings)
=  gnome-tweak-tool   (34% at 4.88)
=  dconf-editor

=  ubuntu-restricted-extras
=  libavcodec-extra
  youtube-dl
=  unity-tweak-tool
=  gconf-editor           (any of these two to get auto raise)

=  geeqie               (old gqview)
=  tkcvs                  (has tkdiff as well, meld is another alternative?)
=  cvsutils
  meld                   alternative to buggy tkdiff
=  openssh-server                  (sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
  sshm                       (shortcut tool, since sshmenu now fails; sshplus is better)

Reminder how to clone your old system ssh settings so multiple versions
will remember the hostname

==>   don't forget to edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config :
      ForwardX11 yes
      ForwardX11Trusted yes

You may try running

that is, for each 
dependencies at 32 bit, install it adding :i386.

For example, skype told me it needs libqt4-dbus at 32bit, I run
> apt-get install libqt4-dbus:i386

what doesn't work?
 - geeqie on ps files
 - digikam 3.5.0 crashes all the time
 - shotwell  (0.18.x) seems to come up with a transparent screen, can't do a thing
 ? no borders around windows is a pain when you use black windows,
       need a grey in it.



sshmenu options?
  - putty
  - SecureCRT (commercial)
  - Gnome-Connection-Manager  (gcm)
  - hotssh
  - sshm/trusty 0.4.3-2 amd64
    command-line tool to manage your ssh servers 


another issue:

- the unity spaces (?) can sometimes hang if you do it in a certain way. can't recover.
  reboot is needed, or you need to know the way to kill the X server or restart nautilus
  or unity really????

- evince on some PS not working (ligature?
  ** seems fixed on 14.10 **

- and then suddenly the dashboard (?) search for launching applications dies.... 
  works ok on files etc. but not apps.
     rm ~/.cache/software-center -R
     unity --reset &    (ah, now deprecated option)
     unity --replace &   
         but this forgets about the placement of windowns.... all piled up in 1, ugly
  welll, after a reboot (or was it logout) this bug went away. 

- sometimes cut and paste via mouse selection doesn't work on first time,
- cutting and pasting not reliable, now you have to more use shift-ctr-C or so.

- used to work, now, sep, expose has isues with remembering the screen view of chrome.
  they go white.
  ** so far, fixed on 14.10, but i saw it once on thunderbird **


- crap, sometimes those default font sizes just rest themselves....
  where is that done. this whole Unity is just full of shit



- then the sound control has disappeared from top bar
  ** dconf got it back, accidentally deleted?
  at least rhytmbox can be controlled again, that died on 14.04

package reminders:

dpkg -S file                 which package owns that file
dpkg -L package              list what files the package gives

screen #0:
  dimensions:    1600x900 pixels (423x238 millimeters)


bugs in unity:   digikam in particular doesn't register with a triangle it's starting up...
so you could easily start up a 2nd one.

flash?

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install my-weather-indicator


glxgears:   dec 7, 2014:    79 frames in 5.0 seconds = 15.644 FPS    (still, slow)
156 frames in 5.0 seconds = 30.993 FPS    after compiz was restarted




Aggrevating issues:
------------------

1)  (hard to explain)     focus follows mouse doesn't work 100% of the time, especially when screens are
    	     		  switched and you have to run in and out of a window to get the focus back wheree
			  you want it.

2)  (intermittend)	  notably the software updater is stuck to the left bar, it doesn't want to open
    			  only way to remove from bar, open fresh

3)  (one time?)           pidgin randomly put a 'b' in the text. so weird

4)  (intermittend)        started recently in chrome: after some backspaces, no more input allowed.

5)  ? 			  suspend doesn't work - but i just upgraded kernel and didn't restart

6)  window focus          probably more feature than bug, but annoying:    if an app has mulitple windows,
                          and it spreads over multiple screens, focus into the other cannot be done.
                          Also if one window even just leaks into another screen, it's also messed up
			  getting focus.


5-feb:
?) expanding a photo in google chrome now hangs the machine.  Didn't try chromium.   Did see a new chrome
   update today. will need to test it.

?) chrome now goes to a mode where text input just doesn' twork anymore. 
   usually after some fast backspaces?
