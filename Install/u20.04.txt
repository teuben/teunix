kubuntu 20.04 has gcc-9.3.0

If you need older version, perhaps something like the following works

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-5 60
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 40
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-5 60
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7 40
sudo update-alternatives --config g++

In debian 9.4 (stretch) default is gcc-6, so do in su mode:
echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unstable.list
apt-get update
apt-get install -t unstable gcc-5
apt-get install -t unstable g++-5

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-5 60
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6 40
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-5 60
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-6 40
sudo update-alternatives --config g++

=== skype:
You may try running
> apt-get install depended_packages:i386

that is, for each 
dependencies at 32 bit, install it adding :i386.

For example, skype told me it needs libqt4-dbus at 32bit, I run
> apt-get install libqt4-dbus:i386


sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ quantal partner" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install skype

get the deb package,install it, but first

glxgears:   dec 7, 2014:    79 frames in 5.0 seconds = 15.644 FPS    (still, slow)
156 frames in 5.0 seconds = 30.993 FPS    after compiz was restarted




Aggrevating issues:
------------------

1)  (hard to explain)     focus follows mouse doesn't work 100% of the time, especially when screens are
    	     		  switched and you have to run in and out of a window to get the focus back wheree
			  you want it.

2)  (intermittend)	  notably the software updater is stuck to the left bar, it doesn't want to open
    			  only way to remove from bar, open fresh

3)  (one time?)           pidgin randomly put a 'b' in the text. so weird

4)  (intermittend)        started recently in chrome: after some backspaces, no more input allowed.

5)  ? 			  suspend doesn't work - but i just upgraded kernel and didn't restart

6)  window focus          probably more feature than bug, but annoying:    if an app has mulitple windows,
                          and it spreads over multiple screens, focus into the other cannot be done.
                          Also if one window even just leaks into another screen, it's also messed up
			  getting focus.


5-feb:
?) expanding a photo in google chrome now hangs the machine.  Didn't try chromium.   Did see a new chrome
   update today. will need to test it.

?) chrome now goes to a mode where text input just doesn' twork anymore. 
   usually after some fast backspaces?
