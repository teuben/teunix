#  Windows 10


Using virtualbox and the Win10_22H2_English_x64.iso (5.7GB) you can find online for free.

Do the usual install from ISO in virtualbox.  Mine allocated 50GB and I used 16GB since I had 64GB memory.

During the install I wasn't paying enough attention so got sucked into the 1 month free trial of ther 99/year thing. I'll need to remember
to cancel the service.

## Screen Size

default size was a bit small. 1024 x 768.  A few more exist, but not enough for my taste.
