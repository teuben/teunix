# Sonoma (14.2.1)

This was a software upgrade from the laptop i mentioned in 12.5 .... now running Sonoma.

Upgrade took a while, but then came back where I left off, even the two

There was some message coming 

      xcode-select --install


Now it's clang 15.0.0, with the usual apple version inflation.
