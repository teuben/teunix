# Linux  Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS

As of this writing (jan 2018) my LTS is at revision 4.  The new LTS
with Gnome3 default is coming out in a few months.

I shiver, and although Unity has its issues, I did not like the amount
of configuration (work) needed to get Gnome3 up to my par. In addition
I didn't see an easy way to label terminals, the bone of my windows :-(
Testing KDE on U17.10 fared better. More to come.
