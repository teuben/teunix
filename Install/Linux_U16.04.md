# Linux  Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS

As of this writing (jan 2018) my LTS is at revision 4.  The new LTS
with Gnome3 default is coming out in a few months, and I need to
consider a new window manager.

I shiver, and although Unity has its issues, I did not like the amount
of configuration (work) needed to get Gnome3 up to my par. In addition
I didn't see an easy way to label terminals, the bone of my terminal
windows :-( Testing KDE on U17.10 fared better. More to come.


## issues

1. an aged window manager often brings up windows that are fully transparent. Especially tkdiff,
   but I've seen chrome and gimp also do it.  Repeating the tkdiff then solves it, eventually.
   This may also be a specific problem with my graphics card, on this THinkpad T530.

2. my emacs is on all virtual windows, and sometimes it's just gone. clicking on the side bar
   (the one unity controls) to toggle visibility doesn't help: it just switches windows. I have
   to kill it and restart emacs. For somebody who has as many emacs buffers as windows on the
   screen this is no fun.

3. meld is often hanging and painful to kill.
