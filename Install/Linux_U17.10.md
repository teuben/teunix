# Linux  Ubuntu 17.10

This was my first KDE test version. I gave up on Gnome3. One nuisance was the large
amount of work needed to set up my preferred environemnt, needing to adjust and add
a lot of 'widgets'. How is one then to port such an environment to another machine?

## issues

1. sometimes loose the KDE window manager. It can be restarted from
   the commandline with

       kstart plasmashell

2. bla.
