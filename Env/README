# MPSE = My Portable Shell Environment

The idea is to have the **teunix** directory off your **$HOME**
directory that contains all your portable stuff, and you make symlinks
into this tree.


## Install

To install, grab a copy

  cd $HOME
  git clone https://github.com/teuben/teunix

and do some surgery from your home directory:

1a. (sh) add this to your .bashrc (linux) or .bash_profile (darwin)

   if [ -f ~/teunix/Env/aliases.sh ]; then
       . ~/teunix/Env/aliases.sh
   fi

1b. (csh) add this to your .cshrc file

   if ( -e ~/teunix/Env/aliases.csh ) then
      source ~/teunix/Env/aliases.csh
   endif


2. emacs: make sure there is no existing .emacs file

   ln -s teunix/Env/dotemacs .emacs

3. github:

   ln -s teunix/Env/dotgitconfig .gitconfig

   If you're not me, better copy and edit your credentials!   

4. path:

   ln -s teunix/Env/bin
   
##  skel

Added here, since these are the skeleton files the astro.umd.edu cluster uses.

## other

There are many others who have shared their dotfile management system, here are a few I ran into and I'd like to take ideas from:
