# MPSE = My Portable Shell Environment

The idea is to have the **teunix** directory off your **$HOME**
directory that contains all your portable stuff, and you make symlinks
into this tree.


## Install

To install, grab a copy

  cd $HOME
  git clone https://github.com/teuben/teunix

and do some surgery from your home directory:

1a. (sh) add this to your .bashrc (linux) or .bash_profile (darwin)

   [ -e  ~/teunix/Env/aliases.sh ] && source ~/teunix/Env/aliases.sh
   
1b. (csh) add this to your .cshrc file


   if ( -e ~/teunix/Env/aliases.csh ) source ~/teunix/Env/aliases.csh

2. emacs: make sure there is no existing .emacs file

   ln -s teunix/Env/dotemacs .emacs

3. github:

   ln -s teunix/Env/dotgitconfig .gitconfig

   If you're not me, better copy and edit your credentials!   

4. path:

   ln -s teunix/Env/bin

5. patch your /etc/hosts with my stuff; see the hosts.local comments, or this:

   sed -n '/HOSTSLOCAL/q;p' /etc/hosts > hosts; cat hosts.local >> hosts; sudo cp hosts /etc

   
##  skel

Added here, since these are the skeleton files the astro.umd.edu cluster uses.

## VPN

### NordVPN

     sh <(curl -sSf https://downloads.nordcdn.com/apps/linux/install.sh)
     sudo usermod -aG nordvpn $USER

then reboot, and use the nordvpn command to login/connect/disconnect/....

     nordvpn login
     nordvpn connect

To add local networking:

     nordvpn set technology openvpn
     nordvpn set protocol tcp
     sudo nordvpn whitelist add port 22
     sudo nordvpn whitelist add subnet 192.168.0.0/16


### UMD

## Interactive of Login shell

Unix makes a difference between an **interactive** and **login** shell, as there are many ways to start a terminal.

## other

There are many others who have shared their dotfile management system, here are a few I ran into and I'd like to take ideas from:
