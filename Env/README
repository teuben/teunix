MPSE = My Portable Shell Environment

The idea is to have a CVS tree off your HOME directory that contains
all your portable stuff, and you make symlinks into this tree, change
the path etc.
This is very much in development, as of Feb 23, 2005.


to install:
  cd $HOME
  cvs -d :pserver:pteuben@cvs.astro.umd.edu:/home/cvsroot co -d Env pjt/Env

potential commands (but careful overwritting old ones)

cd Env
cp dotcshrc ../.cshrc		(or cat >>)
cp dotemacs ../.emacs
(cd ..; ln -s Env/emacs)
(cd ..; ln -s Env/bin)
