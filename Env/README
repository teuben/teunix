MPSE = My Portable Shell Environment

The idea is to have a gittree off your HOME directory that contains
all your portable stuff, and you make symlinks into this tree, change
the path etc.


to install:
  cd $HOME
  git clone https://github.com/teuben/teunix

potential commands (but careful overwritting old ones)

cd Env
cp dotcshrc ../.cshrc		(or cat >>)
cp dotemacs ../.emacs
(cd ..; ln -s Env/emacs)
(cd ..; ln -s Env/bin)
