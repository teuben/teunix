In this directory I place small project bound scripts that set up my
shell for that project. Like the "astroload" system, this means you 
sometimes need to understand that certain packages or projects together
might fail (e.g. due to PATH and/or LD_LIBRARY_PATH) settings.

The only rule there is that the command

	rc name

means there should be a file ~/rc/name.rc, such that

	source ~/rc/name.rc

is successfull. This also implies you pick a shell. There is no
restriction to csh or sh.
