Welcome to UMD Astronomy computing!

For general computing questions or to report hardware/software problems,

Below are a few notes regarding your account settings. For general information
on department computing, see the computing TWiki:

**** Home directories ****
Disk space on all department-maintained Linux workstations (over 100 in all)
is networked together and accessible to each. Your home directory normally
resides on a disk attached to the computer at your desk, which is automatically
accessed by other computers when logging in remotely. In addition---or if you
have no assigned workstation---all users are allotted limited space (5 GB) on
the main department server, earth, in the directory /a/$USER. This space is
available on the network as /n/a/$USER (where $USER is your login username) and
is also used as your home directory on department servers (earth, gaia).


**** Changing your login shell ****

By default accounts use tcsh for their login shell. If you prefer another
shell (e.g., bash, zsh), run 'chsh'; for example, to switch to bash:

  chsh -s /bin/bash


**** Customizing login files ****

A basic set of login files are provided in your home directory for tcsh
(.tcshrc, .tcsh_alias, .tcsh_local, .login) as well as for bash
(.bashrc, .bash_alias, .bash_local, .bash_login). It is recommended to add
any personal additions to .tcsh_local and/or .bash_local. The default contents
of these files are available in /local/skel.


Note that for changes to any of these settings to take effect, you must logout
from your account and login again.
